# Claude Learning Documentation

This folder contains a consolidated learning log from sessions with Claude Code.

## Learning Log

All learning sessions are documented in `learning log.md` for ease of export and review.

## Format

Each entry follows a consistent format:
- **Date:** Session date
- **Topic:** What was learned
- **Key Points:** 3-line summary for each major learning point

Future sessions will be appended to the single consolidated `learning log.md` file.
