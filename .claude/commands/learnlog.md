description: Add a new learning entry to the learning log and commit to GitHub
---

Please help me add a new learning entry to the learning log at `/Users/tklc/learning-docs/learning log.md`.

Follow these steps:

1. Read the current learning log to understand the format
2. Ask me for the following information:
   - Topic/title for this learning session
   - Key learnings (I'll provide 3-5 bullet points for each major learning point)
3. Format the new entry following the existing style with:
   - Date: Use today's date in format DD-MM-YYYY
   - Time: Include timestamp in format HH:MM
   - Topic heading
   - Key Learnings section with numbered items
   - Each item has a bold title and 3 bullet points
4. Append the new entry to the learning log (add separator `---` before new entry)
5. Show me the new entry for review
6. After I confirm, commit and push to GitHub with a descriptive commit message

Important:
- Maintain the existing format and style
- Add timestamps to each entry
- Add the `---` separator between entries
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Create a clear, descriptive commit message
